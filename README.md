For our driveterian we decided to use 1/2 traction with 6 motors. We decided to go with this design as this would give us the most power whiel also giving us a lot of speed. Another thing that this base would be good for is  that we would not move if we ever get hit from the side. It would also give us the ability to go over the center pipe reducing the time to go from one side to the other side of the field. We also decided to reuse screw joints to make the base have as little friction as possible.

We had the motor connected to a 36 tooth gear through an axel. This 36 tooth gear was connnected to a 60 tooth gear. The 60 tooth gear was the one with the omni-wheel connected to it which was connected by screw joint. Like our last design this would reduce our friction by a lot. This was for the bottom and top wheels. For our middle traction wheels we had a simialr design but instead we had the gears connected to two traction wheels rather than an omni-wheel which was also by screw joint. 

needed speed and little torque as we had the traction wheels to climb over the center pipe. We decided to run it at full speed so we can get the most power.
Speed of wheels - RPM of motor X (gear ratio)
= 600 X(36/60)
= 600 X 0.6
= 360

This means that the wheels are spinning at 360 rpm. 
We also connected the motors to the 36 tooth gear. We did this so we would be able to connect the gear between two wheels. This would give us a little bit of extra space when we connecetd the motor. This is becuase the motors would be as close as possible giving us extra space in the front and back for our intake and catapult. 
In terms of battery placement we placed it on the bottom of our robot where the two sides of the bases are connected. This would make it so that the battrey wouldn’t get knocked out if we ever got hit. This also didn’t interfer with going over the center pipe so it was a great placement.

Our Intake:
For our intake to take in triballs we used a horizontally floating intake like many other teams. However, to enhance efficiency, we made significant adjustments. We expanded both the length and width of the intake to accommodate more triballs and to improve intake efficiency during matches. This modification addresses the issue of triballs getting pushed away when approached too quickly with our previous intake design. Furthermore, we replaced the rubber bands used to secure the triball within the robot with latex tubing for better durability and improved grip. Additionally, to facilitate smoother scoring of the triball, we introduced a ram bar in the form of a c-channel, to assist us with scoring the triball with ease. Lastly, we changed our motor placement. Originally we chained the motor and the intake and also used rubber bands to secure gearbox and motor cartridge in place. However, for weight distribution we directly connected the motor to the intake and also used screws instead of rubber bands to secure the motor box preventing it from falling out during a match.

Our Hang:
The hang serevs a purpose of lifitng the robot above the ground. On average this can give you an extra 8% in points if executed succesfully.
Initially, we opted for a 12-tooth to 36-tooth to 84-tooth gear ratio, driven by a red motor at 100 RPM for our hang mechanism. However, due to the weight of our robot, we needed more torque. Hence, we adjusted the gear ratio to 12-tooth to 36-tooth, and then added another set of 12-tooth and 84-tooth gears, all still powered by the same red motor at 100 RPM. This modification was successful, allowing us to get a   B-tier elevation. Subsequently, we encountered issues with our 84-tooth gear snapping from the inside after a certain amount of attempts. To address this, we screwed the 84-tooth gear in with a 72 tooth gear with reinforced steel on the inside, ensuring durability and preventing breakage of the gears.

Our hang bar consisted of two 19-hole long C-channels securely fastened onto two 36-tooth gears. Additionally, the hang bar was equipped with four medium-sized standoffs to provide a firm grip on the climbing pipe. Originally we used standoffs to lock onto the latch, but to enhance stability, we replaced it using a high-strength axle running through both channels.

We opted for an alternative method to secure our hang after the match by incorporating two aluminum channels each with a freely spinning high-strength axle and a screw as a stoppage point. These axles were then rubber-banded down, functioning as a latch mechanism. Upon contact between the latch and the hang bar, this mechanism swiftly locked the hang bar in place, avoid the hang from collapsing after the match.
